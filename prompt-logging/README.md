A number of my projects have some degree of prompt logging.  Need to create the materials to easily incorporate this into my projects.  This also includes extra instructions for verbosity in commit messages.

in general there should be several levels:
- none
- short summary of prompt, short summary of what was changed
- add verbatim copy of prompt
- add commits per group of logically connected prompts, with reference back to the log
- add labels for each "session" to make it easier to see what the state was after a given session

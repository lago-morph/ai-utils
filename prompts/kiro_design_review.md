You are working in the directory [spec directory].  Examine the files there.  Think deeply about the following things, ask clarifying questions, provide commentary, and make recommendations for changes if needed:

1. Are the requirements self-consistent and rational?

2. Does the design appropriately fit the requirements?

3. Are there inconsistencies between design and requirements?

4. Is there redundancy that should be eliminated between design and requirements?

5. Are both files expressed in a way that minimizes length while preserving all information and the ability for a human to appropriately review them?

It is important that we get this part of the review right before moving on to task planning.  Again, make no changes, but do a thorough analysis of these files to try to identify changes we should make now so that planning and implementation goes smoother.
